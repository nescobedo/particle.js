<h1 align="center">Particle.js - Chasing Butterflies</h1>


Learn some cool effects by using Vincent Garreau's Particle.js library.  

Visit his site to create the particle effects you want and easily add them to your site. So many options - custom images, speed, effects, I can't get enough of this library.  

These are particle effects that I use on my portfolio website. At the top of the homepage I use the pixel effect.  I use the butterfly effect on the slide out navigation sidebars.  On the site I alter the sidebar background colors per section for a smoother interaction.  I love particle effects but also know that too much movement is distracting.  Find a way to use particles for your clients - an easy one is background snow for holiday events.  

My dba/website name is Future Butterfles after a line from an Elliott Smith song.  I use that title as metaphor for what I hope to do with your existing website - make it into something beautiful.

This is a working Node.js environment utilizing Gulp 4, Browsersync, Bootstrap 4, Babel, Sass, css/js minification, and sourcemaps.

Credit also to Joe Vains BeerSlider to allow me to show both effects on one page.
